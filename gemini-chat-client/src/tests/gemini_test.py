"""
Unit tests for gemini.py main script using unittest and mock.

This test suite verifies the main application logic in gemini.py, which is the entry point for the Gemini AI chat client.

Testing Strategy:
- The main() function in gemini.py is designed to initialize logging, create the Gemini client, start the chat session, and handle errors gracefully.
- To enable effective unit testing, main() is refactored to accept injected dependencies (log and gemini), allowing us to pass MagicMock objects and assert behavior without running the actual chat loop or writing to disk.
- These tests ensure that logging and error handling work as intended for normal startup, unexpected exceptions, and graceful exits.

Test Cases:
1. test_main_success: Ensures normal startup logs the correct messages and starts the chat session.
2. test_main_critical_exception: Ensures unexpected exceptions are logged as critical errors.
3. test_main_system_exit: Ensures graceful exits (SystemExit) are logged appropriately.

Run these tests with unittest discovery or directly as a script.
